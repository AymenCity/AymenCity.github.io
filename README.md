## Projects
### Phishcord â€“ AI-Powered Phishing Detection Chrome Extension
Phishcord is an AI-powered Chrome extension that detects phishing emails in real-time. Built with Python, Flask, and JavaScript, it uses multiple machine learning models (SVC, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, XGBoost) to classify suspicious messages. Includes manual and automatic detection via Gmail, customisable model selection, and a secure backend with IMAP integration.

### Restaurant Booking Web App
User-friendly, secure, and responsive booking web app for Lancasterâ€™s Restaurant. Built with PHP8+, MySQL, HTML5, CSS3, and Twig, following MVC architecture. Includes user registration, login, booking management, and dynamic calendar/email generation. Input validation uses HTML5 and client-side JavaScript.

### Asteroids Game
Built with C++ and C, this classic space shooter features a user-friendly start screen, playable demo mode, and multiple power-ups. Implemented smooth animations, collision detection, and AI-controlled demo gameplay. Focused on refining gameplay mechanics, fixing bugs, and delivering a polished user experience.

### AirVia Ticket Sales System
Contributed to a team project developing backend and frontend components for AirVia LTDâ€™s Ticket Sales system in Java.

## About Me
I'm a final-year Computer Science with Cyber Security student at City, University of London, graduating in July 2025. I'm passionate about building secure and impactful softwareâ€”whether it's AI tools, full-stack web apps, or games.

I have hands-on experience with Python, Java, JavaScript, C++, and SQL, and enjoy working across both frontend and backend systems. I'm especially interested in cybersecurity, AI/ML, and building things that solve real-world problems.

Outside of coding, I'm a curious and hands-on person who enjoys DIY, helping others learn, and constantly picking up new skills.
